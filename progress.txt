## 2026-01-15: Chat Interface with Radio Traffic Command Recognition

### Feature Implemented
"As a user, I want to type a command like 'Give me the radio traffic for ...' in the chat input so that I can request radio traffic playback"

### Implementation Summary
- Created `ChatInput.tsx`: Form component with textarea and send button
- Created `ChatMessage.tsx`: Message display component with user/assistant styling
- Created `Chat.tsx`: Main chat container with message state management
- Updated `page.tsx`: Replaced default Next.js page with chat interface
- Implemented `isRadioTrafficRequest()` function to detect radio traffic commands

### Key Features
- Textarea input with Enter key submission (Shift+Enter for newline)
- User/assistant message differentiation with distinct styling
- Loading indicator with animated dots
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Radio traffic request detection for phrases like "radio traffic", "radio recording", "give me radio"

### Verification Results
- `bun run build`: Success - compiled and generated static pages

### Notes for Next Iteration
- Next logical feature: Detecting UI elements with type 'radio' in LLM responses
- Consider adding proper LLM integration or mock data for testing
- Audio player component will be needed for actual playback

## 2026-01-15: UI Element Detection for Radio Traffic Responses

### Feature Implemented
"As a user, I want the system to detect UI elements with type 'radio' in LLM responses so that the appropriate playback component is rendered"

### Implementation Summary
- Created `app/types/ui-elements.ts`: Type definitions and parser for UI elements
  - `TranscriptionSegment`, `RadioUIElementPayload`, `RadioUIElement` types
  - `parseUIElements()` function to extract UI elements from LLM response strings
  - Validation functions for type-safe parsing (`isValidUIElement`, `isValidRadioPayload`)
  - Helper functions `hasRadioElement()` and `getRadioElements()`
- Updated `ChatMessage.tsx`:
  - Extended `Message` interface with optional `parsedContent` field
  - Added `RadioTrafficPlaceholder` component to display radio element metadata
  - Renders segment count, speaker count, incident ID, and duration
- Updated `Chat.tsx`:
  - Integrated `parseUIElements()` into message handling
  - Added `getMockRadioResponse()` to generate test responses with radio UI elements
  - Extracts incident ID from user request for realistic mock data

### Key Features
- UI element format: Fenced code blocks with `ui-element` language identifier
- Type-safe parsing with comprehensive validation
- Graceful handling of malformed data (logs errors, doesn't crash)
- Radio element placeholder shows metadata while audio player is pending
- Mock response includes 4 transcription segments with different speakers

### Verification Results
- `bun run build`: Success - TypeScript compilation passed, static pages generated
- `bun run lint`: Success - no ESLint errors

### Notes for Next Iteration
- Next feature: Graceful handling of malformed UI element data (PRD item 3)
- The current implementation already logs errors for invalid data
- Need to add visible error/fallback in UI when parsing fails
- Audio player component needed after error handling is complete
