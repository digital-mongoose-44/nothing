## 2026-01-15: Chat Interface with Radio Traffic Command Recognition

### Feature Implemented
"As a user, I want to type a command like 'Give me the radio traffic for ...' in the chat input so that I can request radio traffic playback"

### Implementation Summary
- Created `ChatInput.tsx`: Form component with textarea and send button
- Created `ChatMessage.tsx`: Message display component with user/assistant styling
- Created `Chat.tsx`: Main chat container with message state management
- Updated `page.tsx`: Replaced default Next.js page with chat interface
- Implemented `isRadioTrafficRequest()` function to detect radio traffic commands

### Key Features
- Textarea input with Enter key submission (Shift+Enter for newline)
- User/assistant message differentiation with distinct styling
- Loading indicator with animated dots
- Auto-scroll to latest message
- Radio traffic request detection for phrases like "radio traffic", "radio recording", "give me radio"

### Verification Results
- `bun run build`: Success - compiled and generated static pages

### Notes for Next Iteration
- Next logical feature: Detecting UI elements with type 'radio' in LLM responses
- Consider adding proper LLM integration or mock data for testing
- Audio player component will be needed for actual playback

---

## 2026-01-15: UI Element Detection for Radio Traffic Responses

### Feature Implemented
"As a user, I want the system to detect UI elements with type 'radio' in LLM responses so that the appropriate playback component is rendered"

### Implementation Summary
- Created `app/types/ui-elements.ts`: Type definitions and parser for UI elements
  - `TranscriptionSegment`, `RadioUIElementPayload`, `RadioUIElement` types
  - `parseUIElements()` function to extract UI elements from LLM response strings
  - Validation functions for type-safe parsing (`isValidUIElement`, `isValidRadioPayload`)
  - Helper functions `hasRadioElement()` and `getRadioElements()`
- Updated `ChatMessage.tsx`:
  - Extended `Message` interface with optional `parsedContent` field
  - Added `RadioTrafficPlaceholder` component to display radio element metadata
  - Renders segment count, speaker count, incident ID, and duration
- Updated `Chat.tsx`:
  - Integrated `parseUIElements()` into message handling
  - Added `getMockRadioResponse()` to generate test responses with radio UI elements
  - Extracts incident ID from user request for realistic mock data

### Key Features
- UI element format: Fenced code blocks with `ui-element` language identifier
- Type-safe parsing with comprehensive validation
- Graceful handling of malformed data (logs errors, doesn't crash)
- Radio element placeholder shows metadata while audio player is pending
- Mock response includes 4 transcription segments with different speakers

### Verification Results
- `bun run build`: Success - TypeScript compilation passed, static pages generated
- `bun run lint`: Success - no ESLint errors

### Notes for Next Iteration
- Next feature: Graceful handling of malformed UI element data (PRD item 3)
- The current implementation already logs errors for invalid data
- Need to add visible error/fallback in UI when parsing fails
- Audio player component needed after error handling is complete

    - Unknown UI element types
  - Updated default message to explain test commands

### Key Features
- Structured error tracking with descriptive messages

### Verification Results
- `bun run build`: Success - TypeScript compilation passed, static pages generated
- `bun run lint`: Success - no ESLint errors

### Notes for Next Iteration
- Next feature: Backend API integration for fetching radio traffic data (PRD item 4)
- Consider adding retry mechanism for transient API errors
- Loading states will need skeleton components for better UX
- Audio player component remains the major UI piece to implement

## 2026-01-15: Backend API Integration for Radio Traffic Data

### Feature Implemented
"As a user, I want the system to fetch radio traffic data from the backend API so that I can listen to recordings"

### Implementation Summary
- Created `app/api/radio-traffic/route.ts`: Next.js API route for radio traffic requests
  - `POST` endpoint accepting `incidentId` parameter
  - `RadioTrafficRequest`, `RadioTrafficResponse`, `RadioTrafficErrorResponse` types
  - `generateMockRadioTraffic()` function for simulated data with 6 transcription segments
  - Simulated network latency (800ms) for realistic loading states
  - Error responses for specific incident IDs (999 = not found, "error" = server error)
- Updated `Chat.tsx`:
  - Added `fetchRadioTraffic()` async function to call the API endpoint
  - Added `formatRadioResponse()` to convert API response to UI element format
  - Added `extractIncidentId()` helper function
  - Changed `handleSend()` to async function with proper API integration
  - Updated default help message to include API error test instructions

### Key Features
- Real HTTP API calls to `/api/radio-traffic` endpoint
- Loading state displayed during API fetch (existing animated dots)
- Error handling for network failures and API error responses
- Test commands for API errors: incident 999 (not found), incident "error" (server error)
- API response includes additional transcription segments (6 vs previous 4)
- Type-safe request/response with exported TypeScript interfaces

### Verification Results
- `bun run build`: Success - compiled successfully, API route registered as dynamic
- `bun run lint`: Success - no ESLint errors

### Notes for Next Iteration
- Next feature: API error handling display (PRD item 5) - partially implemented
- Audio player component is the next major UI piece to implement
- Consider adding more realistic mock data with varied incident types
- Loading skeleton for the radio traffic card would improve UX

## 2026-01-15: API Error Handling with Visual Display

  - Extended `fetchRadioTraffic()` to return `errorCode` from API response
  - Added `createAPIError()` function to convert API error codes to structured `APIError` objects
  - API errors now render as styled error cards instead of plain text

### Key Features
- Three distinct error types with unique icons and messaging:
  - `not_found`: Search icon, "Incident Not Found", suggests verifying incident number
  - `server_error`: Exclamation circle icon, "Server Error", suggests trying again later
  - `network_error`: WiFi-off icon, "Connection Error", suggests checking internet connection
- Visual distinction between API errors (red) and parse errors (amber)
