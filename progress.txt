## 2026-01-15: Chat Interface with Radio Traffic Command Recognition

### Feature Implemented
"As a user, I want to type a command like 'Give me the radio traffic for ...' in the chat input so that I can request radio traffic playback"

### Implementation Summary
- Created `ChatInput.tsx`: Form component with textarea and send button
- Created `ChatMessage.tsx`: Message display component with user/assistant styling
- Created `Chat.tsx`: Main chat container with message state management
- Updated `page.tsx`: Replaced default Next.js page with chat interface
- Implemented `isRadioTrafficRequest()` function to detect radio traffic commands

### Key Features
- Textarea input with Enter key submission (Shift+Enter for newline)
- User/assistant message differentiation with distinct styling
- Loading indicator with animated dots

### Verification Results
